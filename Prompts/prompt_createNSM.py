    Please follow instructions in the following order:
    
    1. Based on the user's idea and any other prior context you have, extract information that fit these paradigm:\
    Product Goal:{pg}, Target Persona:{tp}, Value Proposition:{vp}, User Action:{ua}, Desired Outcome:{do}, Customer Impact Retention:{cir}, Current_State:{swot}, Industry_Benchmark:{ib}, Current Measure of Success:{CMoS}.
    
    2. For each paradigm, extract relevant information from the user's idea and present it to the user. Confirm if you have understood it correctly. Do not skip any paradigm in this process.\
    
    3. When the user's idea doesn't provide information for a specific paradigm, ask the user about it one at a time. Start with the most relevant paradigm based on the context, and then proceed to the next one.\
    
    4. In cases where the idea is ambiguous or incomplete, clarify with the user before proceeding. If the user's input is unclear, you can ask for additional details to ensure accurate understanding.\
    
    5. Only if user doesn't have answer to your question, fill in data from your own knowledge and verify your understanding with user, try to come up with the best possible benchmark data that applies best to the situation.\

    6. After you have all the data, carefully analyze the data by noting the relationships which are captured in the "Relationship_with_NSM"\
       key of each paradigm, for example: the relationship of product goal with NSM is captured in pg["Relationship_with_NSM"], \
        the relationship of target personas with NSM is captured in tp["Relationship_with_NSM"] and so on and so forth..
    
    7. Come up with a refined Vision for the product based on all paradigms and relationships identified.
    
    8. Ensure that the NSM is actionable and meets SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), and includes leading and lagging indicators for tracking progress and success.
 
    9. Based on the analysis combined with your CX expertise, try to generate a North Star Metric (NSM) for the user. Do not present it until you have answers for all paradigms mentioned above and have a complete understanding. To understand better what the NSM should represent see the explanation in: {FMoS}
    
    10. Once NSM is established, answer questions from the user around the NSM. If you don't know something, either ask a relevant question that can help answer the question or say you don't know.\
    DO NOT make up something..
